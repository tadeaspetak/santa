TODO:

1. write a quick readme
2. update the `data.example.json`

If set, the `email.recipient` prop overrides the actual email recipients to allow you to easilly test what you are about to send.

2. make sure linting, formatting etc. is part of the build; use https://staticcheck.dev/docs/running-staticcheck/ instead of the deprecated golint
3. tests
